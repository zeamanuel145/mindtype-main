      "\n",
      "It’s Thursday, December 6th, 2018 and I am sitting in the waiting room at UCSF Mt. Zion Helen Diller Cancer Center waiting to see my oncologist. It’s an ominous time of year because treatment doesn’t take a holiday break. My heart swells thinking of all of the cancer hospitals that are at capacity. When I think about the thirty-year olds with Stage Four cancer. The lost eggs and the missing babies. The fear and the anxiety. The things that are so easy for some yet a daily struggle for others.\n",
      "On Sunday, October 18th, 2015, I ran the Nike Women’s Half Marathon. I had run before - marathons, in fact - so the 13.1 miles didn’t seem the least bit daunting. I was new to San Francisco and training/running with colleagues from my new employer. Zenefits was the fastest growing start-up in the history of Silicon Valley and the antithesis of every east coast workplace where I had spent time in my twenties. There was beer on tap and people wore hoodies and barely spent time at their desks. It was controlled chaos and I quickly drank the Kool Aid. I ascribed to the sixty-hour work weeks and the stock options and the kegs of nitro cold brew. I was older than I was while training for the Boston Marathon, but I was also working start-up hours and - comparatively speaking - Boston is a rather flat place. There was the infamous Heartbreak Hill in Newton, but that was nothing like the daunting hills of Pacific Heights. \n",
      "One Monday morning in early October, my friend picked me up before sunrise. It was pitch black outside and the air was vaguely reminiscent of New England fall. Karl (the Fog) was there in full force as we headed through the Marina, across the Golden Gate bridge and parked by Kirby Cove. Not the least bit of a morning person, I was still half-asleep as we pulled headlamps over our messy top-knots and started our ascent up Hawk Hill. We approached the top just in time to watch the sun pull from the horizon and up over the city. I snapped a photo which I would later post to Instagram so that everyone could see what the overachieving morning-person that I [once] was. What that photograph didn’t reveal is how horribly shitty I felt. I had to stop a few times but my friend was encouraging me and - if I was going to run a half-marathon a week or so later - I could surely sprint up a hill, right?\n",
      "The same thing happened while I ran the 13.1 miles from Union Square via Sea Cliff to Crissy Field. I crossed the finish line and my time was completely reasonable. We drank Bloody Mary’s at The Tipsy Pig and all was good. But during the race - I had stopped twice in those medical tents which, in all my years of running, I had never done. I had my knee taped because, as I recall, it hurt. This isn’t a new thing as I almost couldn’t run Boston one year because of my knee, but - looking back on it - maybe I just felt awful and wanted a break. I wanted to lay on one of the stretchers and catch my breath. Maybe my body was trying to tell me something. After the half marathon, the days went on. Sunday turned into Monday and Monday into Tuesday and I was tired. So tired. And my chest hurt. \n",
      "Less than ten days later - on October 27, 2015 - I was diagnosed with Stage Three breast cancer. I have never been much of an anniversary person. I am a Pisces so not into birthdays or surprises or any attention placed on me at all whatsoever so the 365 day anniversary of something always felt quite arbitrary; much like time itself. \n",
